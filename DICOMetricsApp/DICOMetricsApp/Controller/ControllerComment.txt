Controller must be unitary in nature. 

Application logic is unitary to business logic. Business logic should be able to mix and match variety of application lgoic. 

Controller interface/implementation must be unitary to application logic allowing very small amount of code being written in the application logic layer. 

Controller interface must be numerous and diverse to avoid ONE HUGE M***F**** large fat controller that cannot be tweaked easily. 
Controller should use T template generic type
Controller should entirely depend on the information application logic layer pass to it. 
Controller should not read/interact with other controllers.
